## NERSC Data Seminars Series - Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory

The NERSC Data Seminar Series are held at [Berkeley Lab](https://www.lbl.gov/). The series hosts speakers to:
- Learn about latest science and methods results from researchers
- Learn from software vendors on their product offerings
- Facilitate communications between NERSC and other lab CS staff
  
### Time:
Talks are held at **12-1pm** on **Fridays** and are posted on the [CS Seminars Calendar](https://www.nersc.gov/events/cs-seminars/).  
If you are affiliated with Berkeley Lab you can sign up to receive announcements about the Machine Learning seminars at the [ML4Sci mailing-list](https://groups.google.com/a/lbl.gov/forum/#!forum/ml4sci).
