## Jupyter at NERSC
### Rollin Thomas (NERSC, LBL)

Scientists love using Jupyter because it combines text, visualization, data analytics, and code into a document they can share, modify, or even publish. Many of Cori's data-friendly design features come together through Jupyter to provide a new interface to NERSC resources for doing science. The Spin container-as-a-service platform provides a robust layer for managing the web front-end, JupyterHub. Jupyter plays an important part in NERSC's Superfacility project. On average, 100 people per day use Jupyter "notebooks" through shared login nodes on Cori reserved and configured for the purpose. These notebooks can even communicate with jobs running on Cori compute nodes. Software-defined networking will soon allow users to run notebooks on compute nodes themselves. In this seminar we'll discuss the history of Jupyter at NERSC, get into the nuts and bolts of how Jupyter and JupyterHub work at NERSC, and talk about work we're doing now to enrich the Jupyter in HPC experience. Warning: Live demo.
