# Time-series Analysis of ESnet Network Traffic: Statistical and Deep Learning models
## Debbie Bard (NERSC) and the Superfacility project leads

## Abstract 
The Superfacility Initiative was a key component of the CS Area strategic report, and described the research and engineering required to connect experimental, networking and HPC facilities to accelerate scientific discovery. The Superfacility project was created in early 2019 in response to this Initiative.  The project tracks, coordinates and communicates the work being performed across the CS Area to address the needs described in the Strategic Plan. This includes close partnership with several science teams whose needs are driving our work. In this talk, we will introduce the Superfacility concept and project structure, and the project leads will present their highlight achievements in 2019, and plans for 2020.

## Bio
The Superfacility project includes staff from NERSC, ESnet and CRD.
