## Abstract
Research in Fusion Energy Sciences comprises a big portion of the NERSC workload. Recently FES has developed a long-range plan to guide research priorities. The leaders of this effort will give a summary of these plans with an emphasis on how they involve NERSC and HPC. Outline: Troy Carter Brief overview of FESAC long-range plan with slide on HPC modeling (15 min), Rich Hawryluk main recommendations from NASEM report and strategic plan (8min), Brian Wirth role integrated design teams and integrated modeling (8min), Dave Humphreys report on FES/ASCR machine learning workshop (15 min Q&A).
