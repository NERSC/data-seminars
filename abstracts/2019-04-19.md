## Picture Perfect
### Peter Denes (LBL)

Peter Denes, Uli Dahmen and Kenneth Downing were the recipients of the 2015 Berkeley Lab Prize − Lifetime Achievement Award for their scientific advances and leadership in making Berkeley Lab among the world’s forefront centers for electron microscopy.  In this talk Peter will describe the big picture in advanced microscopy from detector engineering to data analysis. Detectors in use now can generate images at hundreds of kHz and future designs less constrained by e.g. Moore's Law than CPU/GPU technology.  These include instruments such as NCEM's 4DSTEM camera and others in NERSC's super-facility roadmap.  This seminar addresses building devices that extract quality data from experimental and observational science as well as the downstream path for data.
