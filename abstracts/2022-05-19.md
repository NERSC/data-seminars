# Quantum Computing for NERSC Staff
## Katie Klymko, Daan Camps & Jan Balewski (NERSC, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory)

## Abstract
This will be an introduction to quantum computing discussion with a focus on gate-based quantum algorithms. We will cover topics (at a high level) such as what is a qubit, what are quantum gates, and how to read quantum circuit diagrams. We will end with a discussion of common quantum algorithms, with a deep dive into one popular hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, the variational quantum eigensolver.

## Bios
Katie Klymko received her PhD in 2018 from UC Berkeley where she worked on the statistical mechanics of non-equilibrium systems using computational and analytical techniques. She was a postdoc at LBNL from October of 2018 through September of 2021, working on a range of topics including fluctuating hydrodynamics/finite volume methods for modeling mesoscale systems and more recently quantum computing algorithms. Her work in quantum computing has focused on the development of efficient methods for eigenvalue calculations in molecular systems as well as quantum computing algorithms to explore thermodynamic properties. In October of 2021, she became a staff member at NERSC where she is working to integrate HPC and quantum computing.

Daan Camps is a staff member in the Advanced Technology Group at NERSC. His work focuses on integrating emerging quantum technologies in future generation HPC systems.
