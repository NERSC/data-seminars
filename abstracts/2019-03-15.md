## SENSE: SDN for End-to-end Networked Science at the Exascale
### Chin Guok (ESNet, LBL)

Today, domain science applications and workflow processes are forced to view the network as an opaque infrastructure into which they inject data and hope that it emerges at the destination with an acceptable Quality of Experience. There is little ability for applications to interact with network to exchange information, negotiate performance parameters, discover expected performance metrics, or receive status/troubleshooting information in real time. As a result, domain science applications frequently suffer poor performance, especially so in highly distributed environments. This talk will present a vision, and an early instantiation, of an Intelligent Network Service Plane, where the application workflow agents can engage, interact, and obtain custom services from a smart networked ecosystem.
