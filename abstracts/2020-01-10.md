# Independent metadata updating for large scale parallel I/O systems

## Abstract
For bridging the ever-widening performance gap between computation and storage systems, new tiers are introduced to the already deep storage hierarchy. I/O middleware, such as HDF5, has been developed and used for decades to provide applications relatively simple APIs and hide all the low-level details of the underlying I/O and storage systems. As the systems scale out, some of the old designs such as the collective metadata updating mechanism that fits smaller scales start to show the performance penalty. For addressing this problem, we have built a new HDF5-based I/O middleware prototype that enables independent metadata updating. In this presentation, I'll talk about the challenges, the design and implementation of the solutions, and the lessons we learned from building the system.
