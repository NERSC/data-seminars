## Introduction to Deep Learning
### Mustafa Mustafa (NERSC, LBL)

I will introduce the modern incarnation of neural networks, specifically the construction process of deep models that are powering most recent advances in artificial intelligence. Assuming no prior knowledge of the field, the audience will be brought up to speed with how neural networks work, how they are built and optimized and common tricks and techniques to improve their performance. By the end of the talk the audience will be familiar with start-of-the-art convolutional architectures and  the stages of developments that brought them about. If time permits, I will overview common problem instances that can be tackled using deep learning.
