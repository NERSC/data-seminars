# Time-series Analysis of ESnet Network Traffic: Statistical and Deep Learning models
## Mariam Kiran (ESnet, CRD, LBNL)
  
## Abstract 
Predicting network traffic can provide information on large data movement and details on how users interact with the network. As the area of ML matures, we are investigating building predictive models that can provide suitable predictions into the future on how traffic will behave on the network links. The goals of this prediction is to investigate anomaly detection and understanding congestion patterns on the network to help manage them more efficiently. In this talk, we will present our results on time series analysis and also show we plan to deploy these models to perform real-time ML predictions.
