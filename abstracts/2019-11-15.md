# FlowPM: Particle-Mesh N-body Simulation in TensorFlow
## Chirag Modi (UC Berkeley)

The upcoming generation of cosmological surveys such as DESI or LSST will probe the Universe on an unprecedented scale and with unparalleled precision, to answer fundamental questions about Dark Matter and Dark Energy. However, optimally extracting cosmological information from this massive amount of data remains a major challenge, and constitutes a very active research area. Having access to differentiable forward simulations of these surveys paves the way to novel and extremely powerful gradient-based inference techniques. For instance, we have demonstrated potential for over a 50% information gain in constraining Dark Energy using the upcoming DESI galaxy survey. In this talk, we will present FlowPM, the first differentiable cosmological N-body simulation code implemented in TensorFlow for seamless integration with deep learning components and gradient-based inference techniques. After showcasing a few examples of the benefits of such a tool, we will discuss our efforts to scale these simulations to large supercomputers using the Mesh TensorFlow framework.
