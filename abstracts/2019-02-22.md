## Learning quantum states with generative models
### Juan Felipe Carrasquilla (Vector Institute, Toronto, Canada)

The technological success of machine learning techniques has motivated a research area in the condensed matter physics and quantum information communities, where new tools and conceptual connections between machine learning and many-body physics are rapidly developing. In this talk, I will discuss the use of generative models for learning quantum states.  In particular, I will discuss a strategy for learning mixed states through a combination of informationally complete positive-operator valued measures and generative models. In this setting, generative models enable accurate learning of prototypical quantum states of large size directly from measurements mimicking experimental data.
