# Status of Containers in HPC
## Shane Canon, Data & Analytics Group, NERSC

## Abstract 
Containers have quickly gained traction in HPC and Data Intensive computing. Containers provides users with greater flexibility, enables sharing and reproducibly, can make workflows more portable and can even improve performance. In this talk we will review some of these benefits,  the status of containers at NERSC, and trends for containers in HPC. We will also discuss some of the use cases and success stories for containers at NERSC.

## Bio
Shane Canon is a Senior Engineer at Lawrence Berkeley Lab where he works in the NERSC Supercomputing Facility.  Over Shane's 20 year career, he has focused on enabling  scientists to conduct breakthrough science using large-scale systems including some of the fastest computers and storage systems in the world.  Most recently Shane has focused on enabling data-intensive computing and container computing on Supercomputing systems.  Shane is also a senior member of the DOE KnowledgeBase (KBase) project and the National Microbiome Data Collaborative which are two projects focused on advancing genomics science.
