## Machine Learning, Synthetic Biology and Automation: Engineering Life for the Benefit of Society
### Hector Garcia Martin (LBNL, JBEI)

Biology has changed radically in the last two decades, transitioning from a descriptive science into a design science. Synthetic biology leverages engineering approaches to produce biological systems to a given specification (e.g. produce x grams of a medical drug or invade this type of cancer cell). In this effort, new tools are now available that promise to disrupt this field: from CRISPR-enabled genetic editing, to high-throughput omics phenotyping, and exponentially growing DNA synthesis capabilities. However, our inability to predict the behavior of biological systems hampers synthetic biology from reaching its full potential.

We will show how the combination of machine learning and automation enables the creation of a predictive synthetic biology for the benefit of society.
