# Legate: High Productivity High Performance Computing
## Manolis Papadakis (NVIDIA)


## Abstract
The Legate project (https://github.com/nv-legate) aims to provide distributed and accelerated drop-in replacements for popular scientific / data-science libraries (NumPy and Pandas so far). Our goal is to allow programmers to prototype their applications on their local machine, then be able to transparently scale up to large clusters, utilizing the available acceleration hardware, without having to rewrite their application in an explicit parallel programming model like MPI or Dask. By building all Legate libraries on top of Legion's distributed data model and runtime we can achieve seamless asynchronous execution across libraries, with minimal blocking and copying.
