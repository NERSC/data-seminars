# Memory Disaggregation: Potentials and Pitfalls
## Nan Ding (Computer Science Department, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory)

## Abstract
Memory usage imbalance has been consistently observed in many data centers. This has sparked interest in memory disaggregation, which allows applications to use all available memory across an entire data center instead of being confined to the memory of a single server. In the talk, I'll present the design space and implementation for building a disaggregated memory system. I'll then discuss the critical metrics for applications to benefit from memory disaggregation.
