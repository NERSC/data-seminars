# Challenges and successes with a hybrid multicloud implementation for research computing
## Jonathan Skone (NERSC/LBL)

## Abstract
A review of the efforts to evolve an academic on-premises HPC ecosystem to the cloud through the hybrid multicloud solution named Skyway, will be presented. Skyway incorporates multicloud computing resources as elastic extensions of its on-premises HPC infrastructure and makes use of a system-level software package to interface the job scheduler and cloud SDKs, resulting in a seamless experience for users when interacting with both on-premises and cloud resources. The implementation is general enough to interface with one or more cloud providers, which currently include both Amazon AWS and Google GCP.  The challenges encountered and the use cases where it has been successful, will be elaborated.
