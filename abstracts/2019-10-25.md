# Opportunities and Challenges in Linking DAQ and HPC Systems
## David Skinner (Data Science Engagement Group, NERSC)

This talk looks at HPC from the perspective of data acquisition systems (DAQs) at experimental and observational facilities. A systems view of DOE-scale instruments producing data increasingly includes opportunities and/or needs to modulate computational intensity upwards. Experimental facilities that "plug into HPC" for this purpose often include DAQ hardware and systems for which HPC can be a challenge. This seminar reviews related issues from recent data science engagements at NERSC.
