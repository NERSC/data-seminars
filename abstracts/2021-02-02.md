# Machine learning as a tool for Standard Model measurements
## Vinicius Mikuni (University of Zurich)

## Abstract 
The Standard Model of particle physics predicts the interactions between the elementary particles that compose our universe. To study these interactions, protons collide at very high energies at the Large Hadron Collider, generating hundreds of particles through every bunch crossing. In this talk, I will present two measurements: the determination of the ttbb and bbH(bb) cross sections. I will show the difficulties of these determinations and how modern machine learning methods are used to enhance the precision of these measurements.

## Bio
I'm originally from Brazil and finished a Bachelor's degree in physics in 2015 at the University of Sao Paulo. At the same university, I did a Masters in astroparticle physics as a member of the AMS Collaboration, measuring the time variation of electron and positron cosmic ray fluxes. In 2017, I became a PhD candidate at the University of Zurich, working on the field of collider physics as a member of the CMS Collaboration. There I work on precision measurements of Standard Model parameters and how machine learning can be applied to improve measurement precision.
