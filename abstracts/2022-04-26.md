# FirecREST, RESTful HPC
## Juan Pablo Dorsch (CSCS)

## Abstract
FirecREST is a RESTful API to HPC that empowers scientific communities to access compute and data HPC services and infrastructure through a web interface. This API supports and enhances the development of scientific portals that allow web developers and HPC users to adapt their workflows in a more flexible, secure, automated, and standardized way. In this talk, we will present FirecREST and provide an introduction to its capabilities.
