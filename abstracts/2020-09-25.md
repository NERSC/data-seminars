# ExaHDF5: An Update on the ECP HDF5 Project 
## Quincey Koziol (NERSC), Suren Byna (CRD)

## Abstract 
This talk will present an update on the features and future of HDF5 for exascale HPC.  Currently, our work focuses on asynchronous I/O and node-local storage caches, but future work will include GPU direct I/O and data movement across the deeper memory hierarchy anticipated on future systems. 


## Bio
Quincey Koziol and Suren Byna lead the LBNL efforts to develop HDF5's capabilities to meet science application I/O needs now and in the future.
