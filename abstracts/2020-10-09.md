# Generative neural networks: Data-driven simulations for particle physics
## Ramon Winterhalder (Heidelberg University)

## Abstract 
First-principle simulations are a key ingredient in LHC analyses. They are crucial to connect fundamental theories with observable quantities. However, state-of-the-art methods are limited by the high-dimensionality of the phase space, the complexity of the simulation task, and non-trivial correlations. Some of these problems can be alleviated when we add generative neural networks to our toolbox. I will demonstrate how generative adversarial networks (GANs) can be used as a data-driven simulation technique and how technical challenges like training instabilities can be tackled or circumvented. In addition, GANs can be modified to either generate new samples following the multi-dimensional difference of distributions or to accommodate weighted input data while still producing unweighted events. Finally, we can invert the full simulation chain with conditional invertible neural networks (cINNs) and unfold high-dimensional distributions in a statistically meaningful manner.
