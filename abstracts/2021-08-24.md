# JGI Computing - the future is looking cloudy
## Kjiersten Fagnan (Joint Genome Institute/LBL)

## Abstract
The DOE Joint Genome Institute produces high-quality omics data from fungi, plants, microbes, and metagenomes. The computational infrastructure needed to support processing and analysis spans laptops to exascale. JGI has adapted to these needs through moving to a distributed network of computing and storage resources. In this talk I'll describe those resources, what's run where, and the software infrastructure we're building to maintain a high level of usability for JGI's staff and User community.
