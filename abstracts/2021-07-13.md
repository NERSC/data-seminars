# Monitoring Scientific Python Usage at NERSC
## Rollin Thomas (NERSC/LBL)

## Abstract
Last year about 30% of all NERSC users ran jobs involving Python in some way. The most
popular Python package in use in Python jobs isn't NumPy, it's multiprocessing. And among
Python-based MPI jobs, AstroPy appears to be the most significant package in use. How do we
know this and how does this information help us? In this talk, I will discuss how NERSC
monitors the use of Python on its systems, as part of its Monitoring of Data Services (MODS)
project. The talk will cover how the data is collected, stored, analyzed, and published for
consumption by various stakeholders (staff, management, developers, etc.) using a Jupyter
notebook-centric workflow involving GPUs, Dask, Papermill, Voil√†, and Spin.
