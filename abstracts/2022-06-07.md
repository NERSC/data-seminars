# Building a Platform for Operating Multi-Institutional Distributed Services
## Lincoln Bryant (Enrico Fermi Institute - University of Chicago)

## Abstract
Much of science today is propelled by research collaborations that require highly interconnected instrumentation, computational, and storage resources that cross institutional boundaries. To provide a generalized service infrastructure for multi-institutional science, we propose a new abstraction and implementation of this model: Federated Operations (FedOps) and SLATE. We will show the general principles behind the FedOps trust model and how the SLATE platform implements FedOps for building a service fabric over independently operated Kubernetes clusters.  Finally, we will show how SLATE is being used to manage data and software caching networks in production across computing sites in the US ATLAS computing facility in support the ATLAS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider.

## Bio
Lincoln Bryant is a Research Engineer in the Enrico Fermi Institute at the University of Chicago. He has over a decade of experience building and supporting High-Throughput Computing (HTC), distributed storage, and containerization/virtualization systems for both the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider and other collaborations as part of the Open Science Grid Consortium. Lincoln is one of the primary contributors to the Services Layer At The Edge (SLATE) project and has been an active Kubernetes user since 2017.
