## Maglev and the Future of Long Distance Transportation
### John Van Rosendale (Director Computational Science (retired), College of William and Mary)

Maglev is faster and quieter than high-speed rail and has lower life-cycle cost.  The challenge is the large amount of infrastructure required—maglev is completely incompatible with the vast existing rail infrastructure.  With an estimated 1,370,000 km of rail right-of-way worldwide this is a real issue, especially in urban areas where obtaining new right-of-way is very difficult and expensive.

This talk will present a new maglev design, known as “MagFlite,” that uses highly-efficient permanent-magnet-based levitation.  One version of MagFlite is designed to be intercompatible with conventional rail, allowing trains to transition at speed between railroad track and maglev guideways—an idea that can greatly simplifying introduction of maglev around the world.  The talk will end with a discussion of futuristic high-vacuum maglev.  Continent-scale high-vacuum maglev would be far more convenient and efficient than airline travel,  reducing typical travel times by a factor of 10.  Simulation of a hypothetical high-vacuum maglev interconnecting the 100 largest population centers in the continental U.S. is currently in progress.
