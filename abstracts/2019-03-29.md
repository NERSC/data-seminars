## Bridging length scales in granular systems using machine learning
### Utkarsh Mital (CalTech)

In this talk, I draw an analogy between images and granular systems. This enables the repurposing of computer vision algorithms to bridge microscopic and macroscopic length scales and model the mechanics of granular materials. I show that convolutional neural networks can be trained to learn the mechanics of grain-scale interactions, enabling them to model high-level macroscopic properties such as stress. I also demonstrate how GANs could be used to synthetically generate grain-scale data that mimics the distribution of real data. Such a strategy could be further extended to bridge site-specific and regional scales, and employed in the context of downscaling satellite datasets. I discuss an example application of mapping regional liquefaction hazards that could benefit by such advances.
