## Abstract 
Data-driven approaches to predict chaotic spatiotemporal dynamical systems have been shown to be successful for a number of high-dimensional, complex systems. One of the most important chaotic systems which impacts our lives is the atmosphere. This, naturally, leads to the question whether a purely data-driven machine learning algorithm can accurately predict the weather. In this talk, we present a prototype machine learning model that can skillfully predict the three dimensional state of the atmosphere for 3-5 days. The training of the machine learning model is computationally efficient and parallelized over thousands of computer cores. Our results suggest that machine learning has the potential to improve the prediction of atmospheric state variables most affected by parameterized processes in numerical models.
